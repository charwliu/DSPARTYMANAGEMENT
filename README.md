# TMF Party Management API RI

## Introduction

This is the code repository for the reference implementation of the TM Forum Party Management API, used as part of
the FIWARE/TMForum Business API Ecosystem.

Please refer to the [Business API Ecosystem GitHub repo](https://github.com/FIWARE-TMForum/Business-API-Ecosystem) for more
details on this platform.

## API Overview

The Party Management API provides a standardized mechanism for party management such as creation, update,
retrieval, deletion and notification of events.

Party can be an individual or an organization that has any kind of relation with the enterprise. Party is
created to record individual or organization information before the assignment of any role.

For example, within the context of a split billing mechanism, Party management API allows creation of the
individual or organization that will play the role of 3rd party payer for a given offer and, then, allows
retrieval or update of their information.
